# Research and Consultancy

Institutes of Technology were traditionally teaching colleges where we taught from Certificate level up to Doctorate level and the vast majority of our students were at undergraduate level. This is changing and we are teaching more postgraduate courses and starting more organised research groups.

Most work up to now was consultancy for businesses: testing ideas and developing prototypes for quick commercial release. Recently however we are expected to do more longer term (blue sky or theoretical) research.

 

I am currently one of the directors of the gameCore research initiative at IT Carlow.  You will find more details of both consultancy work undertaken and current research on the gameCore website: www.gamecore.ie

My main research interests are:

*     Gamification, specifically gamifying for health improvement and rehabilitation.
*     Concurrency,  specifically offloading to coprocessors such as the Intel Xeon Phi or GPUs, and how they can be successfully used in both gaming and simulations.
*     Agent Based Modelling.
