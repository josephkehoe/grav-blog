Welcome stranger,

This is my new web site.  It contains much the same information as the older one it replaces but has been moved from Wordpress to Grav. Why? Well first to try out a different web framework just for the hell of it.  But also because Wordpress is a bit of overkill for what I need and I just want to be different.

So far Grav is working well.  It is much simpler to manage but required a little bit of server side setup (which was interesting).  It is tied into github and all changes to this site are automatically pushed to my site repository there.  This is an improvement over Wordpress which was a bit more difficult to backup.
