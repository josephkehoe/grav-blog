# Student Projects

We encourage companies to specify projects for our students where practical. This allows companies to assess the standards of our graduates and our graduates to work on real world projects.

The Institute owns the IP of all student projects unless otherwise stated. In some circumstances we can arrange for the IP to belong to the company sponsoring the project but this must be arranged in advance.

Articles about some of these prototypes can be seen at The Engineer, onlyHardware and [ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/99781-therapeutic-computer-games-target-stroke-sufferers/fulltext).
