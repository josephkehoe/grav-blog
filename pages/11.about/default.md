# About me



Welcome stranger, This is the web site for Dr. Joseph Kehoe, Course Director of the BSc in Software Development and Lecturer in Computing in the Institute of Technology Carlow. You should find links to all the information you need at the top of the page.

I am teaching on the both the Software Development and Computer Games Development Degrees. I was the Course Director for the Software Development Degree until 2012. I co-ordinate the final year of the Software Development BSc and the thesis component of the MSc in Data Science.

My office is in room L208 on the first floor of the Haughton Building (its the one without any air conditioning).
